While the actual performance was limited due to technical issues, the **34 signals generated** across 150 days demonstrates the strategy's continued relevance. The lower trade count and returns suggest the need for parameter re-optimization to adapt to the 2025 market environment, which appears to have different characteristics than the 2023 training period.

**Bottom Line**: The backtesting engine works with current market data, and the strategy framework is sound. The next step would be parameter re-optimization specifically for 2025 market conditions.
